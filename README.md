## Project: Predicting Laptop Prices

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook laptop_price_prediction.ipynb
```
or open with Juoyter Lab
```bash
